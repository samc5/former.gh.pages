## Hi, I'm Sam Cowan

**I'm a rising second-year at Boston University studying Data Science and Statistics. Some of my interests are sports analytics, elections, forecasting ([see Tetlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction)), and reading old blogs**

**I'm currently looking for 2025 internships in:**
- Software Engineering
- Data Science
- Data Analysis
- ... and all other similar fields
## Independent Projects

[Papyrss](https://expertify.samcowan.net)  

  A modern RSS Reader built with a Flask backend, a Flutter frontend, and a GraphQL API. Papyrss uses a MongoDB cloud database and is hosted on an Azure virtual machine. Users can subscribe to RSS feeds and categorize them to their needs, as well as bookmark articles, and add feeds to the crowdsourced database.
  I've been building this app since January and intend to continue expanding it for an eventual mobile release.

[Better BU Dining](https://budining.samcowan.net)  
A tool built with Flask and Bootstrap I made at the beginning of freshman year to help myself and others with dietary restrictions navigate the BU dining halls. The actual BU Dining website offers filters but these don't work as intended, particularly for gluten free food. Better BU Dining scrapes the dining hall website with BeautifulSoup and stores the menu every day in a Firebase database. Users can select dietary restrictions which the app looks for in the ingredients lists of the menu items.

[WatchPeglegs](https://github.com/samc5/WatchPeglegs) (not hosted)  
A Flask app I built for the 2023 Stuyvesant baseball season to display a scoreboard above the embedded facebook livestream of our games. I used selenium to scrape the url of GameChanger's private API which was used to update the scoreboard live. Below is a photo from the development process (the only one I have of the now-obsolete site in use)
